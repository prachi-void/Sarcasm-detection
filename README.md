# Sarcasm Detection Using Natural Language Processing

Sarcasm is usually hard to detect because it entails the knowledge of context in which the speaker spoke a sentence and secondly sometimes sarcastic statements are said from the past experience without any certain context.

This project is an attempt to predict sarcasm in a given statement entered by the user in the dialog box.


## Requirements
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Tkinter GUI Programming

The notebook can be executed on Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook.

The Following versions of the Requirements were used:

- Python Version 3.9.7
- Tensorflow version 2.10.0
- Keras version 2.10.0

## Dataset

The dataset used is News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection which was taken from Kaggle. The dataset has two Json files, with 'is_sarcastic' column as '0' for not sarcastic or '1' for sarcastic.

## Code

The main code is present in Sarcasm is very easy to detect GloVe+LSTM.ipynb where data loading, preprocessing, model training and GUI programming etc tasks are performed.

## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook Sarcasm is very easy to detect GloVe+LSTM.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook Sarcasm is very easy to detect GloVe+LSTM.ipynb
or open with Jupyter Lab

jupyter Lab
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
